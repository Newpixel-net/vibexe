# Email Templates

Email templates for Vibexe using [React Email](https://react.email/).

## Development

Start the email preview server:

```bash
pnpm -F studio.giselles.ai email:dev
```

This opens a local preview server at `http://localhost:3333` where you can view and test email templates.

## Static Assets

- Store shared images in `apps/studio.giselles.ai/public/emails`. These files are served from `/emails/*` in production emails.
- The `emails/static` directory is a symlink to the public assets, so the React Email preview (`pnpm email:dev`) can continue to serve `/static/*` without duplicating files.
- Use `getEmailAssetUrl("<filename>")` (re-exported via `emails/components`) to reference any asset. The helper automatically switches between `/static` for preview and `/emails` for production, so **do not** hardcode `baseUrl` yourself.
- `EmailHeader` and `EmailFooter` already include the Vibexe logo, footer logo, and social icons using `getEmailAssetUrl`. Just render them without props—no need to pass URLs or hosts.

## Creating Templates

Add new email templates in this directory. Example:

```tsx
import { Html, Head, Body, Container, Text } from '@react-email/components';

export const MyEmail = ({ name }: { name: string }) => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <Body>
        <Container>
          <Text>Hello {name}!</Text>
        </Container>
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
};

export default MyEmail;
```

## Exporting Templates

Export templates as static HTML:

```bash
pnpm -F studio.giselles.ai email:export
```

Output will be in the `out/` directory.

## Marketing Emails

Marketing emails are stored in the `marketing/` directory. These templates are used for promotional and marketing campaigns.

Common footer (insert in all marketing emails - same structure as transactional emails):

**Structure:**
1. Footer logo (`letter_footer-logo.png`) with reduced opacity (0.3)
2. Links: Product / Blog / Documentation (horizontal, separated by " / ")
3. Social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, Instagram, YouTube)
4. Copyright: `© {current year} Vibexe`
5. Explanation text: "You received this email because you signed up for Vibexe—a platform for building AI agents."

**Links:**
- Product: `https://vibexe.online`
- Blog: `https://vibexe.online/blog`
- Documentation: `https://vibexe.online/docs/en/guides/introduction`

**Social Media Links:**
- GitHub: `https://github.com/giselles-ai/giselle`
- LinkedIn: `https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/giselles-ai/`
- Facebook: `https://www.facebook.com/GiselleAI/`
- X: `https://x.com/Giselles_AI`
- Instagram: `https://www.instagram.com/giselle_de_ai`
- YouTube: `https://www.youtube.com/@Giselle_AI`

#### 📏 Content Tips

- Convey only one purpose (no multiple CTAs)
- Complete within one screen (approximately 400–500px)
- Use 1–2 emojis maximum
- Make it clear what the user should do next
- Use experiential tone: Unify with action verbs like "Build," "Explore," "Collaborate," "Orchestrate"

#### 🪶 End Note

> "Every email from Vibexe should feel like a calm, confident nudge — not a shout."

### Creating Marketing Email Templates

1. Create a new template file in `apps/studio.giselles.ai/emails/marketing/`
2. Follow the same structure as other email templates (header, footer, etc.)
3. Export the component as default

Example:

```tsx
import {
  Body,
  Container,
  Font,
  Head,
  Heading,
  Hr,
  Html,
  Img,
  Link,
  Preview,
  Section,
  Text,
} from "@react-email/components";

interface NewsletterEmailProps {
  userName?: string;
  unsubscribeUrl?: string;
}

const baseUrl =
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL ||
  (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"
    ? "http://localhost:3333"
    : "https://vibexe.online");

export const NewsletterEmail = ({
  userName = "there",
  unsubscribeUrl,
}: NewsletterEmailProps) => {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head>
        {/* Font components */}
      </Head>
      <Preview>Newsletter preview text</Preview>
      <Body style={main}>
        {/* Email content */}
      </Body>
    </Html>
  );
};

export default NewsletterEmail;
```

### Using Marketing Email Templates

To use a marketing email template:

1. Import the template component
2. Render it to HTML using React Email's `render` function
3. Send the HTML via your email service

```tsx
import { render } from "@react-email/render";
import { NewsletterEmail } from "./emails/marketing/newsletter";

const html = render(
  <NewsletterEmail
    userName="John Doe"
    unsubscribeUrl="https://vibexe.online/unsubscribe"
  />
);

// Send email using your email service
await sendEmail("Newsletter Subject", html, recipients);
```

### Best Practices

- Always include an unsubscribe link in marketing emails
- Use clear and engaging subject lines
- Test templates across different email clients
- Keep content concise and focused
- Include a clear call-to-action (CTA)
